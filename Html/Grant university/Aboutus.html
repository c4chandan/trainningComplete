                The original Latin word universitas refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, 
                a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc". At the time of the emergence of urban town life
                 and medieval guilds, specialized "associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually 
                 guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be
                  denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the
                   qualifications of their members.</p>

                   <p style="color:orange;font-size: 20px;">In modern usage the word has come to mean "An institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly
 non-vocational subjects and typically having the power to confer degrees, with the earlier emphasis  
 
 on its corporate organization considered as applying historically to Medieval universities.</p>

<p style="color:rebeccapurple;font-size: 20px;">The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in Western and Central Europe,
 where this form of legal organisation was prevalent and from where the institution spread around the world.
